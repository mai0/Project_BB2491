# Project_BB2491
Assembling and annotating the Norway spruce chloroplast genome

Goals
You will assemble contigs from the data your are given (see below), extract the chloroplast
contigs, and the annotate the chloroplast genome model. I would like to see:
  - A GenBank file containing a genome model and gene annotation.
  - A visualisation of the circular cp genome (see "Resources" below).
  - Are there any rearrangements in the cp genome, as compared to other well known
    plant's chloroplasts?
  - An attempt at identifying the "inverted repeat", the two regions IRA and IRB (one is
    "original" and one is "copy") which are virtually perfectly conserved. How large is the IR
    in Picea abies?


There will be a diary on 'Wiki' for all the information regarding the progress of the project
